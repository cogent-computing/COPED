The Catalogue of Projects on Energy Data (CoPED) was originally
produced by Coventry University.  They would like to acknowledge the
financial and technical support of EPSRC EnergyREV
(EP/S031863/1). EnergyREV is funded by UK Research and Innovation
through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund. CoPED would like to
thank project delivery partner Energy Systems Catapult (ESC) for their
significant role in developing the software specification and advising
on community engagement. We also like to recognise the Department of
Business, Energy and Industry strategy (BEIS) in providing the
stimulus to develop the platform.
