# COPED: Catalogue of Projects on Energy Data

COPED, or the Catalogue of Projects on Energy Data aims to unify various information stores and existing portals for energy projects under a single extendable umbrella that has two key roles:

1. Update, curate and correct information pertaining to the existing energy project landscape through manual and automated processes.
2. Offer a wide range of visual aids, query tools and metrics that enable users to synthesize information across the energy projects landscape at a given time.

COPED aims to provide diverse insights for various user groups, while being able to continuously expand its data capture sources and the analytics and visualisations it can perform.

As a platform, CoPED aims to be extensible. It is configured as a standard "Django" web application, and its analytics and visualisation component runs independently from the data management component.

As CoPED reaches maturity and wide adoption, the product aims to allow individuals and institutions to contribute extensions and features to the product, as well as uploading, curating, and analysing existing data.
